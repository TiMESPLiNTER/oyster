# Oyster üêö

Oyster is the shell of all shells. Written in PHP.

To get started with it just run `composer install` and set the `console` file as your default shell and magic will happen.

If you don't trust Oyster yet: just execute the `./console` file from your current shell and you will see that the world
can look way brighter and better listening and talking to the right shell.

## Configuration

Of course you can adjust Oyster so it fits your needs and style. Oyster will look for a `.oysterrc` file in your home
directory.
